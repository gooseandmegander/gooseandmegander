## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Megan (she/her). Nice to virtually meet you!

I'm an interior architecture student turned software developer. I :heart: building, learning, and collaborating.
And, for the time being, I am open to new opportunities!

Much of my GitHub is older projects from my bootcamp days at Lambda School. I'm in the process of planning some updates as well as new projects.

NOTE: You may have noticed my contribution chart is not very green. :( My contributions from my previous employer do not show because I was on a GH account they provided me. I've also been _hella_ studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam and writing less code. I'm also human and promise I do actually like writing code. :)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in...

everything, but to be specific:

- cloud technology
- design systems
- accessibility
- networking
